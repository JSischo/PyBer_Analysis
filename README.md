# PyBer Ride Share Analysis
## Overview and Scope of the Analysis
At the request of the PyBer companies CEO, we were to conduct an analysis of ride-sharing data for a given region. The main focus of this analysis was to look at and compare different key performance indicators for the rural, suburban and urban areas. The KPIs that we looked at were Total Fare by city type per week, total rides per area, avg fare per ride and average fare per driver per a given timeframe.

## Results
Following is a comparison and discussion of some key findings during the analysis of the rideshare data.

  >Key metrics for the different city types.
 
The above summary demostrates some data that one might expect, the ***Urban*** region had the most **Total Rides, Total Drivers and Total Fares**. The second most was the ***Suburban*** cities and finally the ***Rural*** cities had the least.

However, this is flipped when we look at the Average Fare data. We see that the ***Rural*** cities had the **largest Avg. Fare Per Ride**, a little over *33%* more than the Urban cities and about *12%* more than the Suburban cities. This holds true for the **Avg. Fare per Driver** with the ***Rural*** drivers taking in about *230%* more and about *40%* more per ride than their Urban and Suburban counterparts respectively.

The graph below is charting the revenue generated per city type on a per week basis over the timeframe of interest. We also see what might be logically expected in that the region with the largest population and the largest number of drivers, the Urban area, consistently generated the most revenue. This was followed by the Suburban cities with the next largest weekly fare amounts followed by the Rural cities. Again, no real surprises there.

What we do see is a few items of note:
1. There seems to be a small upward trend in total Fares during this timeframe for the Urban areas.
2. The Suburban and Rural areas seem to be flat. So the good news here is that they don't seem to be trending down.
3. There seems to be a small common uptip in Total Fares in all 3 City Types in late February.
