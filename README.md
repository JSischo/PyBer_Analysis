# PyBer Ride Share Analysis
## Overview and Scope of the Analysis
At the request of the PyBer companies CEO, we were to conduct an analysis of ride-sharing data for a given region. The main focus of this analysis was to look at and compare different key performance indicators for the rural, suburban and urban areas. The KPIs that we looked at were Total Fare by city type per week, total rides per area, avg fare per ride and average fare per driver per a given timeframe.
## Results
Following is a comparison and discussion of some key findings during the analysis of the rideshare data analysis.

    - When we look at the changes within Thomas High School, we again see some very small changes. The average ***math*** score **dropped .1%**, average ***reading*** score **increased .1%**. The overall passing percentages are essentially unchanged.
    
- **How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?**

## Summary

Below are screen shots showing how the THS numbers changed during the anaylsis process when the NaNs were added to the the 9th grade reading and math scores.

>Thomas High School Scores when the analysis was run with the NaNs in the DataFrames.

We see that a number of the metrics changed:
1. Significant drop by about 26% in the percent of students with passing math scores.
2. Significant drop by about 27% in the percent of students with passing reading scores.
3. These numbers both impacted the overall passing percentage with a decrease of about 25%.
4. These numbers were then corrected in the script when the number of 9th grades at Thomas High School where removed from the THS school count, percentages where recalculated and then inserted into the school summary DataFrame.
